# 🔄 Modernize .NET Applications

Welcome to Chapter 2 of the modernization workshop! This section focuses on modernizing your .NET Framework applications to modern .NET using different approaches and tools.

## 📋 What You'll Learn

In this chapter, you'll explore two different approaches to modernize your .NET applications:

🛠️ **Traditional Migration**: Using .NET Upgrade Assistant for structured, step-by-step migration  
🤖 **AI-Powered Modernization**: Leveraging GitHub Copilot for intelligent, automated modernization  

Both approaches accomplish the same goal - transforming your legacy .NET Framework application into a modern .NET application - but use different methodologies and tools.

## 🚀 Choose Your Path

Select the approach that best fits your learning style and requirements:

### Option A: .NET Upgrade Assistant (Traditional Approach)
**[🔄 Modernize with .NET Upgrade Assistant](./2-modernize-with-dotnet-upgrade-assistant/README.md)**

- Structured, step-by-step migration process
- Uses Microsoft's official .NET Upgrade Assistant tool
- Provides detailed control over the migration process
- Ideal for understanding the technical details of .NET migration

### Option B: GitHub Copilot Modernization (AI-Powered Approach)
**[🤖 Modernize with GitHub Copilot](./2b-modernize-with-ghcp-modernization-app/README.md)**

- AI-driven modernization with intelligent suggestions
- Leverages GitHub Copilot's modernization capabilities
- Automated analysis and upgrade recommendations
- Ideal for exploring AI-assisted development workflows

## 🎯 Next Steps

After completing either approach (or both!), you'll be ready to move on to:
