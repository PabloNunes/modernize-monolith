# 🚀 Modernize your monolith: From .NET Framework to microservices in Azure

In this full-day workshop, you'll take a legacy [.NET Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/) monolith and modernize it to the latest [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/) release using AI-powered tooling and [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot) agents. You'll learn how to layer in cloud-native capabilities with [.NET Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/) for service discovery, telemetry, and orchestration, containerize the app, and deploy it to [Azure Container Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/) using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and [Bicep](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/). Along the way, you'll even explore how to integrate [Azure AI services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/) to enhance your application with intelligent capabilities, culminating in a production-ready microservices solution built for scale and agility.

## 📚 What you'll learn

By the end of the day, you'll have gained:

⬆️ Hands-on experience upgrading to modern .NET  
🏗️ Practical experience of building cloud-native applications with .NET Aspire  
🚀 End-to-end deployment skills using Azure Container Apps with azd and GitHub Actions

### 📋 Prerequisites

You should be familiar with [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and .NET - enough that you're comfortable with your way around web APIs and [Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/) applications. We'll cover some GitHub Copilot and .NET Aspire along the way - but don't worry, you don't need to be an expert in either. We'll also talk about microservice architecture and deployment to Azure Container Apps. That's going to mean [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/) and containers. It would be good for you to have a basic understanding of cloud computing and containers, but again, you don't need to be an expert.

Here are some things you will need:

🔨 [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)  
☁️ Access to an Azure subscription  
🤖 Access to a GitHub Copilot Pro subscription  
🐳 [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or another way to run container images locally)

## 🎯 Getting started

This workshop is split into 8 different parts. Each shows you an aspect of modernizing your app. The sections each have their own learning materials and hands-on exercises in sub-folders.

1. [🔧 Setup your environment](./1-setup-your-environment/README.md)
2. [🔄 Upgrade .NET Applications](./2-upgrade-dotnet/README.md)
3. [🤖 Modernize with GitHub Copilot app modernization](./3-modernize-with-github-copilot/README.md)
4. [🏗️ Refactor into microservices](./4-refactor-into-microservices/README.md)
5. [⭐ Add .NET Aspire (service discovery, dashboard / telemetry)](./5-add-dotnet-aspire/README.md)
6. [🚀 Add additional Redis for caching (add to Aspire)](./6-add-redis-caching/README.md)
7. [☁️ azd to deploy to ACA](./7-deploy-to-aca-with-azd/README.md)
8. [🧠 Add in some AI](./8-add-ai-capabilities/README.md)

Let's go! 🎉
